# Data Science task


Semanticâ€‹ segmentation model with UNet architecture using Keras.
Model builded on the dataset which contains a large number of segmented nuclei images

## Notebook

You may see model, data analys, etc in google colab notebook, located at `google-colab-notebooks` or just visit https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1k0V8bMGDUocoq4klF5YYF-TzSfJkGrr0?usp=sharing

## How to install & run

In order to run model and install dependencies use these commands:

1. Create virtual environment
 - $ `pyhon3 -m venv venv`

2. Activate your virtual environment
 - (venv) $ `source venv/bin/activate`

3. Install dependencies
 - (venv) $ `pip install -r requrements.txt`

## Download dataset, train model & predict masks 

Now you can run scripts:

4. Download and extract the dataset
 - (venv) $ `python getdataset.py`

After script execution you'll see two folders in the data folder with `test` and `train` data

`train` data containes images and its mask

`test` only images

5. In order to predict masks for images in the test folder, execute:
 - (venv) $ `python predict_masks.py`

 Predicted masks for the test images has to appear in `predictions` folder


6. If you want to train neural network, run:
 - (venv) $ `python train.py`

Notice that model already trained. Model and weights located in `model` folder

## Other

`config.py` -- defined some constants

`model.py` -- loads model from `json file` and its `weights` from `model` folder

`functions.py` -- functions to read images, masks, generate train batch
